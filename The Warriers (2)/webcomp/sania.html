    <h2><center>From Facing Gender Bias To Receiving Padma Bhushan: Saina Nehwal Has Been A Trailblazer</center></h2><br>&nbsp;
    <p align="center">The world cheered for Saina Nehwal in 2015 when she became the first Indian female player to be ranked as number one as a badminton player. Her journey till now is an inspiration for every girl who has ever been told that girls cannot do certain things or walk shoulder-to-shoulder with men.</p>&nbsp;
   <p align="center">Born in 1990 in Hisar, Saina Nehwal is the daughter of Usha Rani and Harvir Singh Nehwal. When her father was promoted and transferred to Hyderabad, she took up badminton to fulfil the dream of her mother to become a national-level player. Usha Rani had been a state-level player.
    Saina’s father broke his provident fund to ensure that her training continues in one of the best courts in the city.</p>&nbsp;
    <p align="center">In 2010, Saina confessed that her grandmother did not come to see her until a month after she was born. She wanted a boy and was utterly disappointed at her and her sister’s birth. 

        She was seven when she came to know about the preferences of her grandmother. It shook her to her core and made her realise what gender discrimination was. 
        
        Despite facing gender bias at home, Saina has blazed a trail for several girls in India as well as the world. There is hardly anyone in the field of sports, especially badminton, who does not know her name. She is a legend.
        
        In an interview, Nehwal said women are equal to men in all aspects of life. She also emphasised the need to eliminate poverty, spreading awareness about women empowerment and promoting education in the country. She also spoke about the atrocities that women face in the country and said that they should try to remain positive and pursue happiness in the best way they can.</p>
